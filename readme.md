# AI Code Converter Senior Project 

## Basic Github Info

### Workflow
* A new branch should be created for each story
* Each branch should have a name relevant to the story it covers
* Every branch must undergo a code review before merging to Main
* Each code review must have 2 approvals before merging (not including original author)


### Project Website & Documentation
* The project website is located at `/docs/index.html`
* To update the project website, **changes must be pushed to main**
* To update just the project website, use the `Documents` branch, otherwise changes can be made when a branch is merged to main.
* Any documentation, images, or local information that is displayed on the project website is also stored here and linked to the website locally
* The site will be maintained throughout the course of the project
